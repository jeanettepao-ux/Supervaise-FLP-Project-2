# CJ Panganiban Conversation App

A voice conversation app that speaks as retired Philippine Chief Justice
Artemio V. Panganiban, grounded in his published corpus (65 columns + 1 book of
19 chapters + 4 appendices = 89 documents, ~150K words).

Built per `corpus/build_kit/README.md`. This directory is the runnable app.

## Pipeline

```
[mic]
  ↓ faster-whisper (local STT)
User question (text)
  ↓ Claude Haiku 4.5 (router)
1–3 canonical topic IDs from topic_map.json
  ↓ load topic data + 2-3 raw doc extractions
Context block
  ↓ Claude Sonnet 4.6 (inference, in CJ's voice)
Response text
  ↓ Piper (local TTS)
[speakers]
```

Two Claude API calls per turn. Everything else runs locally.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 (3.12 also works; faster-whisper builds are most stable on 3.11)
- A working microphone and speakers
- An Anthropic API key in `.env` (file is gitignored)

### Run the smoke test (text-only — no audio)

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe cj_chat.py --text "What is the rule of law?"
```

This skips STT/TTS and exercises the full router → inference pipeline. You
should see the routing decision (primary topic, secondary, confidence) and a
response written in CJ's voice (twin beacons, *Au contraire*, "Cheers!" etc.).

### Run the full voice loop

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe cj_chat.py
```

Press Enter to start each turn. Speak your question. The recorder stops
automatically after ~1.2s of trailing silence. The app transcribes, routes,
generates, and speaks the response. Ctrl+C to exit.

### Run the audience dashboard (optional)

The dashboard is a Streamlit page that mirrors what the CLI is doing —
showing the question, routing decision, and CJ's response in big readable
type. Useful for projecting to an audience while you drive the CLI.

Open **two** terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — the CLI (drives the mic + speakers)
.venv/Scripts/python.exe cj_chat.py

# Terminal 2 — the dashboard (browser UI for the audience)
.venv/Scripts/streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Then open the URL Streamlit prints (default `http://localhost:8501`).
The dashboard auto-refreshes every second.

The CLI writes turn state to `state/current.json` (gitignored, regenerated
each turn). The dashboard reads it — there's no other coupling, so if the
dashboard crashes the CLI keeps working, and vice versa.

`piper/` and `voices/` are gitignored — they're large binary assets installed
per-machine. See "From-scratch setup" below to reinstall.

## From-scratch setup

```bash
# 1. Create venv
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -U pip
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Create .env (DO NOT commit) — see .env.example for the format
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and paste your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# 3. Install Piper TTS (Windows binary)
#    Download piper_windows_amd64.zip from
#    https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/releases
#    and extract into ./piper/

# 4. Download the voice model
#    https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/main/en/en_US/ryan/high
#    Save both files into ./voices/:
#       en_US-ryan-high.onnx
#       en_US-ryan-high.onnx.json

# 5. (Optional) Pre-fetch the whisper model — it auto-downloads on first run
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -c "from faster_whisper import WhisperModel; WhisperModel('medium', device='cpu', compute_type='int8')"
```

## Configuration

Set these in `.env`:

| Var | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | (required) | Claude API key |
| `WHISPER_MODEL` | `medium` | `small` (English-only) or `medium` (Filipino/English code-switch). 769 MB download. |
| `PIPER_BIN` | `./piper/piper.exe` | Path to the Piper executable |
| `PIPER_VOICE` | `./voices/en_US-ryan-high.onnx` | Voice model path |

## Sanity-check questions

From the build-kit README — verify the voice and routing before demo day:

| Question | Expected |
|---|---|
| "What is the rule of law?" | → `rule_of_law` high. Mentions twin beacons, 1987 Constitution. |
| "Tell me about your mentor." | → `mentor_salonga` high. Tells the 1956 FEU strike anecdote. |
| "What's your favorite color?" | → `personal_formation` low. Gracefully declines, redirects. |
| "Tell me about the Foundation." | → `flp_institutional_history` high. 2011 founding, twin beacons. |

## Cost & performance

A 50-turn demo session: ~$0.80 total (Haiku router + Sonnet inference).

Targets:
- End-to-end turn latency: ≤ 4s (TTS streaming is the typical bottleneck)
- Per-turn cost: ≤ $0.02
- Router accuracy: ≥ 85%

## Architecture notes

- **Two Claude calls (router + inference) instead of one** keeps the inference
  context small (10–20K tokens for 1–3 topics + 2–3 raw docs) rather than
  stuffing 320KB of topic_map into one giant call. ~$0.015/turn vs ~$3/turn.
- **Local STT/TTS** keeps audio off the network for cost, latency, privacy,
  and demo reliability (only Claude calls need wifi).
- **The voice card is the system prompt** on the inference call, not a user
  message. If CJ sounds generic, double-check that wiring first.

## What's not yet here

Per the build-kit README, these are deliberately out of scope for the May 30
demo:
- Speech corpus (~150 CJ speeches — Pass B addition)
- Multi-turn memory beyond last 10 turns (already trimmed in code)
- Robot embodiment (Reachy Mini wiring)
- Web UI (CLI only)
- Response caching
- Real-time interruption handling

## Troubleshooting

- **"Router output unparseable"** — Haiku occasionally adds preamble. The
  reference impl strips code fences; if it persists, drop router temperature
  to 0.
- **Whisper hallucinates "Thank you" on silence** — VAD is on by default.
  If still happening, bump `vad_parameters={"min_silence_duration_ms": 1000}`
  in `transcribe_audio`.
- **Piper sounds robotic** — that's Piper. Swap to OpenAI TTS `onyx` or
  ElevenLabs for production-quality voice. `synthesize_speech()` is the
  single point of change.
- **CJ sounds generic / not like himself** — confirm `voice_card.md` is being
  loaded as the `system=` parameter on the inference call (not a user
  message). Confirm model is `claude-sonnet-4-6` or better.
